Your job is to reorder each word alphabetically while removing duplicate characters.\nThe intercepted message is a string where:\n\u2022 Each word has unique characters.\n\u2022 Each word should be sorted alphabetically.\nYour task is to write a program that processes the scrambled message, applies these rules, and returns the deciphered version.\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5\n- s consists of lowercase English letters, spaces and leading, trailing whitespaces.\n\nExample:\nInput : \"hello olleh world wworld\"\nOutput: \"ehlo ehlo dlorw dlorw\"\n\nExplanation : \n- \"hello\" becomes \"ehlo\"(duplicates removed and sorted)\n- \"olleh\" becomes \"ehlo\"\n- \"world\" becomes \"dlorw\"\n- \"wworld\" becomes \"dlorw\"\n\nInclude all the necessary imports and only provide the `decipherMessage` function."
