The values in each vector represent the quality of the items. The indices of the items in the vectors indicate their priority, with lower indices having higher priority and contributing more significantly to the final quality of the output.\n\nThese two sets of items can be rearranged (swapped between the two vectors) to form two batches. The goal is to maximize the combined efficiency of the two batches, which depends on how effectively the items are distributed between the vectors.\n\nTo measure this efficiency, treat the vectors as the digits of two numbers. The larger the multiplication result of these two numbers, the higher the combined efficiency, indicating that the items have been optimally distributed between the two batches.\n\nComplete the function `maxProductArrangement` to determine the arrangement of the two vectors A and B that maximizes the product of the two numbers formed by their elements. \n\nOther details:\n- The values in the vectors (quality of items) are integers ranging from 1 to 9, inclusive.\n- Each vector can have a maximum size of 20 elements.\n- Both the input vectors will be of the same size.\n- Swapping within a single vector is not allowed as it would change the priority order. Only swapping between the two vectors at corresponding indices is allowed. For example, you can swap A[i] with B[i], but not A[i] with A[j].\n- Ensure the solution efficiently handles the case where both vectors reach their maximum size.\n- The result should ensure that the first vector (`batch1`) must be lexicographically greater than or equal to the second vector (`batch2`) meaning the quality of `batch1` must be higher than or equal to `batch2`.\n\nGive the complete implementation of the function `maxProductArrangement` along with necessary imports, don't provide the `int main()` function."
