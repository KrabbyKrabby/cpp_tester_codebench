Modify this implementation to support multi-threading in a distributed environment. Specifically:\nEnsure thread safety for all operations (push, pop, read, rollback, and commit) to avoid race conditions when accessed by multiple threads concurrently.\nUse appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., std::mutex or std::shared_mutex) to allow safe access to shared data structures.\nAllow the database to handle operations efficiently by minimizing contention among threads.\nThe rollback and commit operations should be atomic to ensure consistent states across threads.\nProvide a revised implementation, ensuring the database functions as expected under concurrent usage while adhering to the existing method signatures.\nAlso, Implement a mechanism to save the currentState and history to disk during a commit operation and Load the saved state from disk when the database is initialized, restoring the last consistent state in the constructor and save state on destructor. Also, add a clear() function to delete any states from the disk\nAdhere to C++17 standards or higher for modern and efficient coding practices.  Use the same function prototypes, class names but do not implement `main()` function."
