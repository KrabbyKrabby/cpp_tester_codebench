The enhancement should focus on optimizing the mark-and-sweep mechanism and extending functionality to detect and resolve circular references among managed objects. These enhancements are crucial for preventing memory leaks and ensuring robust memory management in high-load environments. The updated class should also be capable of operating safely in multi-threaded applications. Return the existing code implementations along with the modifications you made.\n\n\nList of Functions to Implement:\n1. Sweep Function: `void sweep();`\n   a. This method should perform the sweep phase of the garbage collection process in a thread-safe manner to accommodate multi-threaded application contexts.\n   b. It should iterate over all allocated objects, removing those that are not marked as used, with operations protected by mutex locks to prevent race conditions.\n   c. Objects that are marked should have their marks cleared in preparation for the next cycle to ensure that only currently active objects are retained.\n   d. Implement efficient handling with reduced lock contention to minimize traversal and deletion time, ensuring the garbage collector remains performant even with a large number of objects under concurrent access.\n\n2. Circular Reference Detection: `bool detectCycle(ManagedObject* obj, std::unordered_set<ManagedObject*>& visited, std::vector<ManagedObject*>& stack);`\n   a. This function should implement a cycle detection algorithm to identify circular references within the network of managed objects using a depth-first search (DFS) that is enhanced to handle concurrent modifications.\n   b. It should ensure that if `obj` is revisited during traversal (found in both visited and stack), a cycle is present, indicating a dependency loop which must be resolved without disrupting multi-threaded operations.\n   c. This method should return true upon detecting a cycle, thus identifying objects that reference each other cyclically and are not eligible for garbage collection until these cycles are resolved.\n   d. Proper synchronization mechanisms or lock-free techniques should be used to manage the shared data structures during the cycle detection to enhance the system's stability and prevent memory leaks from uncollected circular references in a multi-threaded environment.\n\n3. Compact Memory Function: `void compactMemory();`\n   a. This method should optimize memory usage by compacting the fragmented memory resulting from frequent allocations and deallocations.\n   b. It should rearrange the objects in memory to be contiguous, reducing the space between live objects and potentially improving cache utilization and access speeds.\n   c. Implement strategies to move objects while updating references to them within the managed heap, ensuring that no references become invalid after compaction.\n   \n4. Mark All Function: `void markAll();`\n   a. This method is responsible for the marking phase of the garbage collection, where it iterates over all root objects and marks them and their reachable references.\n   b. It should traverse the graph of objects starting from each root, marking each object as active (used).\n   c. Implement this to efficiently handle potentially large graphs, minimizing stack overflow risks by using an iterative approach if recursion depth becomes an issue.\n\n5. Mark Function: void `mark(ManagedObject* obj);`\n   a. This function marks a single ManagedObject as used, ensuring it and its connected objects are not swept away.\n   b. It recursively marks all objects reachable from the given object, accounting for cycles with an internal mechanism to prevent infinite loops.\n   c. Optimize this method to handle large interconnected networks of objects, possibly incorporating mechanisms to limit redundant marking operations.\n   \n6. Handle Circular References Function: `void handleCircularReferences();`\n   a. Aimed at detecting and resolving issues where objects are mutually reachable only by each other, creating cycles that traditional mark-and-sweep would not clean up.\n   b. This function should implement a robust cycle detection algorithm to identify groups of objects that are inter-referencing and therefore should be collectible if no external references are pointing to any object in the group.\n   c. Essential for preventing memory leaks where circularly referenced objects are not needed but persist due to mutual references.\n"
